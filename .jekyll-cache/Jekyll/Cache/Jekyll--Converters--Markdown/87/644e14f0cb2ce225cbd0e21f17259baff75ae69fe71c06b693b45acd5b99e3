I"A<p>Limp Bizkit is an American nude metal band from Jacksonville, Florida. A great representative of nu metal through its mixture of rap and metal, the group nevertheless defines its music as being “pimp-rock”. In 2010, Limp Bizkit counted 35 million albums sold worldwide. The name of the group is a deformation of Limp Biscuit (literally “Soft Biscuit”).</p>

<p>Limp Bizkit was created in 1994 in Jacksonville, Florida, by Fred Durst, a son of a police officer, and Sam Rivers. Sam introduces his cousin John Otto to Fred who takes on the role of drummer. Rob Waters is recruited as a guitarist. The group released during the following year a first cassette demo entitled Mental Aquaducts. Rob Waters left the group shortly after. Terry Balsamo (future Cold then Evanescence) will take up the post of guitarist for a while before leaving in turn. It is Wes Borland who will finally be the guitarist of the group.</p>

<p>When Korn went to Jacksonville in 1995, the group’s bassist, Fieldy, was tattooed by Durst, who then earned his living as a tattoo artist, and a friendship was born between the two. During the group’s next visit to the region, Fieldy leaves with a model he finds so impressive that he hands it over to director Ross Robinson. Thanks mainly to word of mouth, the group is chosen to ensure the first part of the farewell tour of House of Pain which also stars Deftones. In the course of 1996, they recorded a second demo, the songs of which will serve as the basis for their future first album. Shortly after, DJ Lethal (House of Pain) will complete the training.</p>
